## Foursquare_capstone_project
Repository created to store a simple recommendation system built with fousquare API data and Python.

## Project objective:
* Given a input containin restaurant of format {'price_level':[1.0],'rating':[4.3],'user_ratings_total':[107],'lat ':[-24.128515],'lon':[-46.689152]}, the algorithim recommends 5 other similar category restaurants.

## How it was developed:
* Data was scrapped from google places api, for SÃ£o Paulo city in brazil.
Code for data collection can be found on: <br/>
[Data gathering](app/data/main/get_place_data.py)<br/><br/>

* Data was then preprocessed and stored in a mysql db,which is attached to the project.
Code for data collection can be found on: 
<br/>[main jupyter notebook](app/recomendation_system.ipynb)<br/><br/>

* Data was finally segmented using Kmeans, and then used to get the best 5 restaurants ranked by review rate
Code for this step can also be found on:
<br/>[main jupyter notebook](app/recomendation_system.ipynb)<br/><br/>

* Code for a full recommendation can be found on:
<br/>[recmmendation engine](app/make_recommendation.py)<br/><br/>
